# EmployeeManagementSystem

This repository contains a fullstack web application for managing employee data. The system follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture and implements **RESTful web services** for handling CRUD operations.

- **H2** â€” Embedded or relational database
- **ORM** (Object-Relational Mapping) â€” For mapping Java objects to database tables
